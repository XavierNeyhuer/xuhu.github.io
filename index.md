My name is Hu Xu(徐虎). Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a M.S. student in the [College of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Kun Zhu](http://inet-nuaa.cn/kunzhu/). Before that, I have finished my undergraduate study at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and received my B.E. degree in July 2019.

My research interests include machine learning and data mining. Specifically I am working on reinforcement learning and its application.
